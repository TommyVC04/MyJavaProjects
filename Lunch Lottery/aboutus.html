  <p>Hey, my name is Tommy, the original creator of this project. This application was inspired by my younger brother as a way for people to have an easy way to meet new people or just mix things up.   <br /> <br />

  	I love anything challenging such as coding, puzzles, and sports. I play soccer at my high school and lacrosse nationally, so any free time I have is spent in front of my computer or TV with a video game controller in my hands. <br /> <br />
