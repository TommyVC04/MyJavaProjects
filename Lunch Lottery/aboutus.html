  <p>Hey, my name is Tommy, the original creator of this project. This application was inspired by my younger brother as a way for people to have an easy way to meet new people or just mix things up. I love anything challenging such as coding, puzzles, and sports. 
    I play soccer at my high school and lacrosse nationally, so any free time I have is spent in front of my computer or TV with a video game controller in my hands. <br /> <br />

  <p>Hi, my name is Gregor, and Tommy brought me on here because I too enjoy making things on the computer. I really liked the idea that Tommy brought to me and I thought it would be a) a good thing to do and b) it would be fun, so here we are.
    I enjoy playing video games, I play baseball, some soccer, and I run track as well. I spend my free time learning up on how our universe works and other assorted coding stuff :)
